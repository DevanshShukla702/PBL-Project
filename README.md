Abstract:
Traffic congestion is a growing challenge in urban areas, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. An AI-powered traffic prediction system aims to address this issue by leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and real-time data to deliver accurate traffic forecasts. This system integrates data from diverse sources such as GPS devices, traffic cameras, weather reports, and historical traffic patterns to analyze and predict traffic flow. Utilizing techniques like deep learning, time-series analysis, and natural language processing, the system provides dynamic and location-specific predictions. The outputs enable city planners to optimize traffic management strategies, while commuters can make informed decisions to reduce delays. The project also explores scalability for smart city integration, ensuring it adapts to varying data scales and urban complexities. The AI-powered traffic prediction system holds promise for improving mobility, enhancing road safety, and promoting sustainable urban development.
